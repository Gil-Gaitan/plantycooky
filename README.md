# A flask app with user database

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Plant Seeds Cook** web application! This is a Flask-based app that Iâ€™m building to showcase my backend development skills, data engineering, and algorithm implementations. It serves as a learning and application hub for web technologies such as databases, APIs, and user authentication. A micro blog site built with a turtorial will be a piller of the application for UI and web based features. 

This project includes:
- **Flask** for backend development
- **SQLAlchemy** for database interactions
- **Flask-Login** for user authentication
- **Docker** for containerization

### Features
1. **User Authentication:** Secure login/logout functionality with password encryption.
2. **Homepage:** Dynamic posts and messages for authenticated users.
3. **Data Engineering:** Backend linked to a MySQL database for managing user data.
4. **Pagination:** Properly implemented pagination for lists of posts or content.
5. **Dynamic Routing:** Routes include home, login, and logout, with content rendered dynamically based on user data.
7. **Unit Testing:** Basic unit tests for validating key functions and routes.
